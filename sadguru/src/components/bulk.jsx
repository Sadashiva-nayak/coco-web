            A few years ago, we were asked by various manufacturers to start
            supplying our lovely products in bulk. So thatâ€™s exactly what we
            did. Today, we trade multiple niche coconut ingredients to some
            fabulous health food companies across the globe that blend our stuff
            into exciting new things.
